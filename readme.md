# Alarm Clock

A Python-based alarm clock application with a simple graphical user interface (GUI). This project allows users to set alarms, configure settings, and manage alarm sounds. It is designed to run on systems with a Raspberry Pi for GPIO-based buzzer functionality.

## Why did I make this?

  - This program was made for several reasons

    - I needed a visual clock for my computer station that doesn't require me squinting or wearing my glasses to read the clock in the corner of my screen. I have multiple computers set up across several monitors, so it's easy to run this program on my Raspberry Pi while I do whatever on my main machine.

    - No more switching out of a fullscreen application to see the time. GAME ON!

    - The alarm sounds work better than ANY alarm I've ever set on any phone I've owned. They actually wake me up! I prefer the GPIO Buzzer, as the audio file scares my wife every time it goes off.

    - My youngest child is currently potty training. Setting the snooze to 60 minutes works great as an hourly "potty timer" for her to try using the "big potty". We prefer the GPIO Buzzer, as it's a simple sound she recognizes throughout the house.

    - I have a purpose built Raspberry Pi for coding small projects, media playback, personal and media storage, and this program with touchscreen and battery backup that has a built in buzzer. This brings portability to the project and makes it great for many things around the house where an alarm clock or timer of sorts may be useful.

## Features

- Set and manage alarms
- Customizable alarm sounds
- Snooze functionality
- Configuration file for persistent settings
- Simple and intuitive GUI
- GPIO buzzer integration for Raspberry Pi
- Fullscreen mode for better visualization
- Customizable clock colors and appearance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required libraries: `tkinter`, `configparser`, `pydub`, `simpleaudio`, `RPi.GPIO`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/B-Boone/alarm_clock.git
   cd alarm_clock
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install tkinter configparser pydub simpleaudio RPi.GPIO
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the `clock_ui.py` script to start the alarm clock application:
   ```bash
   python clock_ui.py
   ```

2. Use the GUI to set alarms and configure settings as needed.

## Project Structure

- `alarm_clock/`: Directory containing main application scripts
- `__pycache__/`: Directory for compiled Python files
- `alarm.wav` `TF006.wav` `TF048.wav`: Alarm sound files
- `clock_ui.py`: Main GUI application script
- `config_manager.py`: Script for managing configuration settings
- `gpio_handler`: Script for managing the GPIO Buzzer configuration
- `popup_menu.py`: Script for managing the customization menu
- `clock_config.ini`: Configuration file for storing settings
- `clockipy.png`: Image file for the application icon

## Configuration

The clock_config.ini file stores the alarm clock settings, including alarm times and sound preferences. You can edit this file manually or through the GUI customization menu.

Example clock_config.ini:
```ini
[COLORS]
second_color = #00ff00
minute_color = #0000ff
hour_color = #ff0000
border_color = #00ff00
bg_color = black
markings_color = #0000ff
numbers_color = #ff0000
alarm_display_fg_color = #d9d900
hour_button_fg_color = #ff0000
minute_button_fg_color = #0000ff
hour_button_brdr_color = #ff0000
minute_button_brdr_color = #0000ff
dtdow_color = #b09300
dtdat_color = #a85c84
dttim_color = #397c8c

[SETTINGS]
gpio_pin = 20
snooze_time = 5
alarm_hour = 12
alarm_minute = 30
alarm_method = both
alarm_sound_file = ~/alarm_clock/alarm_clock/TF006.wav
```

## Core Features:

- **Fullscreen Clock**: Display time in a frameless window mode.
- **Interactive**: Click anywhere on the screen, besides the corner buttons or alarm time display, to access customization options, minimimize, or close the program.
- **Custom Background**: Customize the background with an image of your own.
- **Set Alarm**: Incremental buttons to set hours and minutes for the alarm.
- **Visual Alarm**: A pop-up notification appears when the alarm rings.
- **Stop/Snooze/Reset Alarm**: Buttons to stop and keep the previous alarm, stop and snooze the alarm, or stop and reset the alarm.
- **Alarm Reset**: The alarm can be reset, or "shutoff", by clicking the alarm time display under the middle of the clock or by cliking the reset button when an alarm plays.
